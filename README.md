## Description
**hsh** is a simple command line interpreter based on the functionality of the POSIX 1003.2-conformant Dash command line interpreter on Ubuntu 14.04. It was implemented as part of a group project for the low-level programming track at Holberton School in San Francisco. For pedagogical reasons, **hsh** was written using only limited subset of the C89 standard library (see [Implementation](#implementation)).
